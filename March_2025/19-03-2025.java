// Difficulty: HardAccuracy: 48.35%Submissions: 48K+Points: 8
// In the stock market, a person buys a stock and sells it on some future date. You are given an array prices[] representing stock prices on different days and a positive integer k, find out the maximum profit a person can make in at-most k transactions.

// A transaction consists of buying and subsequently selling a stock and new transaction can start only when the previous transaction has been completed.

        int n = prices.length;
