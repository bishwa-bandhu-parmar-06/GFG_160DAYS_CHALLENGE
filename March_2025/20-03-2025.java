// In daily share trading, a trader buys shares and sells them on the same day. If the trader is allowed to make at most 2 transactions in a day, find out the maximum profit that a share trader could have made.

// You are given an array prices[] representing stock prices throughout the day. Note that the second transaction can only start after the first one is complete (buy->sell->buy->sell).
