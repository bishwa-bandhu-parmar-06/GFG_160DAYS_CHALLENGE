# Given an n × 3 matrix mat[][], where each row represents the costs of three available choices at a shop, select exactly one choice from each row such that the same choice is not selected in two adjacent rows.

# Return the minimum total cost required.

# Examples:

# Input: mat[][] = [[1, 50, 50], [50, 50, 50], [1, 50, 50]]
# Output: 52
# Explanation: One optimal selection is- Row 1: Choice 1 (Cost = 1), Row 2: Choice 2 (Cost = 50), Row 3: Choice 1 (Cost = 1)
# Total cost = 1 + 50 + 1 = 52.
# Input: mat[][] = [[1, 4, 1], [3, 2, 2], [3, 2, 3]]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: One optimal selection is- Row 1: Choice 1 (Cost = 1), Row 2: Choice 2 (Cost = 2), Row 3: Choice 3 (Cost = 2)
# Total cost = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.
# Constraints:

# 1 ≤ n ≤ 105
# 3 ≤ mat[0].size() ≤ 3
# 1 ≤ mat[i][j] ≤ 100
# mat.rows = n


class Solution:
    def minCost(self, mat):
        a,b,c=0,0,0
        for y in range(len(mat)):
            a,b,c=min(b,c)+mat[y][0],min(a,c)+mat[y][1],min(a,b)+mat[y][2]
        return min(a,b,c)
