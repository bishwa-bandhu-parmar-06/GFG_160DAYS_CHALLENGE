# Marks from Ranks
# Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 53.19%Submissions: 9K+Points: 4
# Consider an input where all marks obtained are divided into intervals of consecutive numbers represented as l[] and r[] where l[i] and r[i] represent the starting and ending marks (inclusive) of the i-th interval. 

# The intervals are sorted in increasing order and do not overlap.
# The rank of a mark is defined by its position among all valid marks in increasing order, with the smallest mark assigned rank 1, the next smallest rank 2, and so on.
# Given an array rank[]. for each value in rank[], find the corresponding mark and return as an array.

# Examples:

# Input: l[] = [1, 6, 14], r[] = [3, 9, 15], rank[] = [2, 5, 8]
# Output: [2, 7, 14]
# Explanation: The valid marks are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, 15. Their corresponding ranks are 1 to 9 as there are 9 distinct marks. Therefore, rank 2 corresponds to mark 2, rank 5 corresponds to mark 7, and rank 8 corresponds to mark 14.
# Input: l[] = [5, 10], r[] = [7, 12], rank[] = [1, 4, 6]
# Output: [5, 10, 12]
# Explanation: The valid marks are 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12. Their corresponding ranks are 1 to 6 in increasing order. Hence, rank 1 corresponds to mark 5, rank 4 corresponds to mark 10, and rank 6 corresponds to mark 12.
 

# Constraints:

# 1 ≤ l.size(), l[i], r.size(), r[i], rank.size(), rank[i] ≤ 105
