# Given an array arr[]. Initially, you have another array containing only 0s.
# In one operation, you may either:

# Choose any one element and increase its value by 1, or
# Double the values of all elements in the array simultaneously.
# Find the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial all-zero array into the given array arr[].

# Examples:

# Input: arr[] = [16, 16, 16]
# Output: 7
# Explanation: 
# First, increase each element to make the array [1, 1, 1] (3 steps).
# Then, multiply the whole array by 2 four times:
# [1,1,1] -> [2,2,2] -> [4,4,4] -> [8,8,8] -> [16,16,16]
# Total steps = 3 + 4 = 7.
# Input: arr[] = [2, 3]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: 
# Start from [0, 0].
# Increase both elements to get [1, 1] (2 steps)
# Multiply once: [2, 2] (1 step)
# Increase second element once: [2, 3] (1 step)
# Total steps = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.
# Constraints:
# 1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
# 0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 109

        for x in arr:
            res += bin(x).count("1")

        mx = max(arr)
        if mx > 0:
            res += mx.bit_length() - 1

        return res
