# Visit Leaves with Budget
# Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 50.05%Submissions: 48K+Points: 2
# Given a binary tree and an integer k, where you start from the root at level 1. The cost of visiting a leaf node is equal to the level of that leaf node. You can visit any number of leaf nodes, but the total cost of visiting them must not exceed k.

# Return the maximum number of leaf nodes that can be visited within the given budget.

# Examples:

# Input: root[] = [10, 8, 2, 3, N, 3, 6, N, N, N, 4], k = 8

# Output: 2
# Explanation:
# Cost For visiting Leaf Node 3: 3
# Cost For visiting Leaf Node 4: 4
# Cost For visiting Leaf Node 6: 3
# To maximize the number of visited leaves, choose the two cheapest leaves: Cost = 3 + 3 = 6 ≤ 8. 
# Thus, the maximum number of leaf nodes that can be visited is 2.
# Input: root[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], k = 5

# Output: 1
# Explanation: The leaf nodes are 4, 5, 6 and 7, and all are at level 3. Therefore, visiting each leaf costs 3. With a budget of 5, we can visit only one leaf because: 3 ≤ 5, but 3 + 3 > 5. Thus, the maximum number of leaf nodes that can be visited is 1.
# Input: root[] = [1], k = 1         
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The root node is also a leaf node and is at level 1. Therefore, its visiting cost is 1. Thus, the maximum number of leaf nodes that can be visited is 1.
# Constraints:

# 1 ≤ size of binary tree ≤ 105
# 1 ≤ k ≤ 104
