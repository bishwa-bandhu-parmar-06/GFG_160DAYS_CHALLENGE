# Given a number n, find the number of ways to represent this number as a sum of 2 or more consecutive natural numbers.

# Examples:

# Input: n = 10
# Output: 1
# Explanation: There is only one way, 10 = 1+2+3+4.
# Input: n = 15
# Output: 3
# Explanation: There are 3 ways, (15 = 1+2+3+4+5), (15 = 4+5+6) and (15 = 7+8).
# Constraints:
# 1 ≤ n ≤ 108


class Solution:
    def getCount(self, n):
        parts = 2
        base = n - 1
        count = 0
        while base >= parts:
            if base % parts == 0:
                count += 1
            # The next part will be "part" numbers
            # higher than the first one.
            base -= parts
            parts += 1
        return count
