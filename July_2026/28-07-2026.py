# Given a weighted undirected graph with V vertices numbered from 0 to V - 1, represented by an array edges, where edges[i] = [ui, vi, wi] indicates that there is an edge between vertices ui and vi with a weight of wi. (wi can only be 1 or 2), and two vertices src and dest, find the shortest distance from src to dest.

# The shortest distance is defined as the minimum total weight required to reach dest starting from src.

# Return the shortest distance from src to dest. If dest is not reachable from src, return -1.

# Examples:

# Input: V = 4, edges[][] = [[0, 1, 1], [0, 2, 2], [2, 3, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 2]], src = 0, dest = 3

# Output: 3
# Explanation: One of the shortest paths from vertex 0 to vertex 3 is 0 -> 1 -> 3 with a total weight of 1 + 2 = 3.
# Another shortest path is 0 -> 2 -> 3 with a total weight of 2 + 1 = 3.
# Hence, the shortest distance from 0 to 3 is 3. 
# Input: V = 5, edges[][] = [[0, 1, 1], [0, 2, 2], [1, 2, 1], [3, 4, 2]], src = 1, dest = 3

#  Output: -1
# Explanation: There is no path from vertex 1 to vertex 3, so the answer is -1. 
# Input: V = 5, edges[][] = [[1, 0, 1], [0, 3, 2], [1, 3, 1], [1, 2, 2], [2, 3, 2], [3, 4, 1], [2, 4, 1]], src = 1, dest = 4

# Output: 2
# Explanation: The shortest path from vertex 1 to vertex 4 is 1 -> 3 -> 4 with a total weight of 1 + 1 = 2.
# Hence, the shortest distance from 1 to 4 is 2.
# Constraints:
# 2 ≤ V ≤ 105
# 1 ≤ edges.size() ≤ min(2*105,  V*(V-1)/2)
# 0 ≤ edges[i][0], edges[i][1] ≤ V-1
# edges[i][0] != edges[i][1]
# 1 ≤ edges[i][1] ≤ 2
