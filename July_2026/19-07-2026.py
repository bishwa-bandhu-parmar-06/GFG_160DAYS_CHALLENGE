# Given an array arr[] and a list of queries. For each query [l, r], find whether the subarray arr[l...r] is a mountain array. A subarray is called a mountain array if there exists an index k (l ≤ k ≤ r) such that: arr[l] ≤ arr[l + 1] ≤ ... ≤ arr[k] ≥ arr[k + 1] ≥ ... ≥ arr[r].

# Elements of a Mountain subarray are first non-decreasing and then non-increasing.
# A subarray that is entirely non-decreasing or entirely non-increasing is also considered a mountain.
# Examples:

# Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 2, 4, 4, 6, 3, 2], queries[][] = [[0, 2], [1, 3]]
# Output: [true, false]
# Explanation: For query [0, 2], the subarray is [2, 3, 2]. The elements first increase and then decrease, so it forms a mountain.
# For query [1, 3], the subarray is [3, 2, 4]. The elements decrease and then increase, so it does not form a mountain.
# Input: arr[] = [2, 2, 2, 2], queries[][] = [[0, 2], [1, 3]]
# Output: [true, true]
# Explanation: All subarrays of the given array are mountain.
# Constraints:
# 1 <= arr.size(), queries.size() <= 105
# 1 <= arr[i] <= 106
# 0 <= l <= r < arr.size()
