# Consider an array a[] = [1, 2, 3, ..., n] and a permutation b[] of size n containing all integers from 1 to n exactly once.

# The array b[] defines a rearrangement operation.
# During a single operation, every element at position i in a[] moves to position b[i] (1-based indexing).
# We must do at least one operation on a[].
# Find the minimum number of operations required for all elements to return to their original positions simultaneously, i.e., for a[] to become: [1, 2, 3, ..., n] again.

# Note:  The answer can be large, so return the answer modulo 10^9+7.

# Examples:

# Input: b[] = [1, 2, 3]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: Initially, a[] = [1, 2, 3] and b[] = [1, 2, 3]
# After one operation:
# a[1] = 1 goes to position 1 as b[1] = 1.
# a[2] = 2 goes to position 2.
# a[3] = 3 goes to position 3.
# so, now a[] becomes [1, 2, 3].
# All elements remain at their original positions. Hence, the answer is 1.
# Input: b[] = [2, 3, 1, 5, 4]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: The sequence of arrays obtained after each operation is:
# Initially : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# 1 : [3, 1, 2, 5, 4]
# 2 : [2, 3, 1, 4, 5]
# 3 : [1, 2, 3, 5, 4]
# 4 : [3, 1, 2, 4, 5]
# 5 : [2, 3, 1, 5, 4]
# 6 : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# After 6 operations, all elements return to their original positions simultaneously. Therefore, the answer is 6.
# Constraints:
# 1 ≤ n ≤ 104
# a.size() = b.size() = n
# b[] is a permutation of integers from 1 to n.
