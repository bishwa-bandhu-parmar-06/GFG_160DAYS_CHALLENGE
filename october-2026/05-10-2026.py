# Geek is creating a social networking site called Geeksbook with n users numbered from 1 to n. Each user i (2 ≤ i ≤ n) has exactly one friend, and that friend must have a smaller user number than i. User 1 has no friend. The friends of users 2 to n are given in an array arr[] of size n - 1, where:

# arr[0] is the friend of user 2.
# arr[1] is the friend of user 3.
# ...
# arr[i - 2] is the friend of user i.
# The relationship is one-way. A user can reach another user by repeatedly following their friend's link. For every user i from 2 to n, find all users j (1 ≤ j < i) that can be reached from i. For every reachable pair (i, j), create an array [i, j, k] where:

# i is the starting user.
# j is the reachable user.
# k is the number of links that must be followed to reach j from i.
# The result should contain these arrays in the following order:

# Process users i from 2 to n.
# For each user i, consider users j from 1 to i - 1 in increasing order.
# Include [i, j, k] only if j is reachable from i.

# Return a 2D array containing information about all reachable pairs.

# Examples:

# Input: arr[] = [1, 2]
# Output: [[2, 1, 1], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1]]
# Explanation: The links are 2 → 1 and 3 → 2. User 2 can reach user 1 in 1 link. User 3 can reach user 1 in 2 links. User 3 can reach user 2 in 1 link.
# Input: arr[] = [1, 1]
# Output: [[2, 1, 1], [3, 1, 1]]
# Explanation: The links are 2 → 1 and 3 → 1. User 2 can reach user 1 in 1 link. User 3 can reach user 1 in 1 link.
# Constraints:

# 2 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 500
# 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 500
