// Given a 2D array arr[][], where arr[i][0] is the starting time of ith meeting and arr[i][1] is the ending time of ith meeting, the task is to check if it is possible for a person to attend all the meetings such that he can attend only one meeting at a particular time.

// Note: A person can attend a meeting if its starting time is greater than or equal to the previous meeting's ending time.
