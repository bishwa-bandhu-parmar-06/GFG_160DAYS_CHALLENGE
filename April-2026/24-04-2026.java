// Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 40.46%Submissions: 37K+Points: 2
// Given the array arr[] of heights of certain buildings that lie adjacent to each other, Sunlight starts falling from the left side of the buildings. If there is a building of a certain height, all the buildings to the right side of it having lesser heights cannot see the sun.

// Find the total number of buildings that receive sunlight.

// Examples:

// Input: arr[] = [6, 2, 8, 4, 11, 13]
// Output: 4
// Explanation: Only the buildings with heights 6, 8, 11, and 13 receive sunlight; therefore, the output is 4.
